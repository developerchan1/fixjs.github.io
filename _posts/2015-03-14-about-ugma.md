I have always had a dream to implement something cool, lightweight and handy, something which allows JavaScript develelopers to come up with a nice looking JavaScript app without them having to spend ages on coding. For sure [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) has been one of the best during the whole of my career as JavaScript dev __BUT__ as we all now know it has a lot of issues like the one that I read about couple of weeks ago: [Investigate the performance and consider the removal of usage of .hide() and .show() from Javascript](https://github.com/easydigitaldownloads/Easy-Digital-Downloads/issues/3065).

The point is not just about a performance bottlenecks. Other than performance, what I usually have in my concerns list, are code size, DOM API, browser support, cross device coding priciples and stuff like that, which [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) usually offers a whole bunch of solutions for them. But now I've got a better alternative which is [Ugma](https://github.com/ugma/ugma) made by someone: [kflash](https://github.com/kflash) who has a really brilliant ideas on how to acheieve all of them without killing the code size, someone who I know in person. I made this post as the initial trigger for providing him with our feedbacks.

I myself will put my feedbacks on the commnet box below, you could leave your comments as well, if you find this interesting.
