# My past projects

This is where I put the actual source code of my old but interesting JavaScript projects.
An interesting combination of the two word: `old but interesting`.
A quick look is enough for it to find issues, bad practices or even bugs. But considering the point that, this projects had been getting developed around 5, 6 or even for **ZinoX** around 7 to 8 years ago, I'd say there is a lot to learn as well.

## ZinoX
A JavaScript client framework aiming to set up an end to end solution for **S**ingle **P**age **A**pplications(SPAs) and enterprise `web` applications.

## Flowchart Designer
As its name suggests it is a fully JavaScript based flowchart designer which allows to design your desired flowchart in a browser.
