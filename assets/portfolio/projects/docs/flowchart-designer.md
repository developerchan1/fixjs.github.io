## Flowchart Designer

As its name suggests it is a fully JavaScript based flowchart designer which allows to design your desired flowchart in a browser.

__Flowchart Designer__ was actually the key part of a bigger product, A BPMN . The company I was working with at the time, was kind of the only provider in the BPMN market at the time and we had decided to implement a web based BPMN Modeler for modeling enterprise BPMN processes.

The idea was kind of new and challenging in the local market in my home country but in europe couple of companies had been working on that for a while. One of them was [Signavio](http://www.signavio.com) which was focused around the same idea but with a difference: the front-end stack was centered around SVG, but ours was more of a JavaScript based solution with a bit use of HTML5 canvas element.
