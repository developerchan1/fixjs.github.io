This means building on our competitive strengths like URLs and dynamic loading, as well as taking a hard look at our platform’s weaknesses — lack of access to modern hardware, failures of the offline experience, or limitations of cross-origin communication, to name a few. --**Dave Herman**\r\n\r\nThis is what we are concerned with in FixJS as a team of JavaScript enthusiasts.\r\n\r\n#Promoting and Writing Modular JavaScript\r\nFor JavaScript to make it easier to write clean and maintainable code. What we are working on these day, in this specific regard is mostly dealing with JavaScript module patterns and coding styles to come up with a lightweight, effective and efficient approach.\r\n\r\nSo far we have come up with a lightweight implementation of [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/blob/master/AMD.md) module format which still doesn't support node modules yet, but it will soon do it.\r\n\r\n#[DefineJS](http://fixjs.github.io/define.js/)\r\nA JavaScript module loader, an implementation of AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
